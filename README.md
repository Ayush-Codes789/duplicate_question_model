# duplicate_question_model

A  Deep Learning–based Duplicate Question Detection System that identifies whether two given questions are semantically similar (duplicate) or different.

The complete implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for easy understanding and experimentation.

Project Overview

Online platforms often face the problem of users asking the same question in different ways.

This project aims to automatically detect such duplicate questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
